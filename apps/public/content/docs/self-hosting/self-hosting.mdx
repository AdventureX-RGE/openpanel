<Callout>OpenPanel is not stable yet. If you still want to self-host you can go ahead. Bear in mind that new changes might give a little headache to keep up with.</Callout>
<Callout>From version 0.0.5 we have removed Clerk.com. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you will need to export your users from Clerk and import them into OpenPanel. Read more about it here: [Migrating from Clerk](/docs/self-hosting/migrating-from-clerk)</Callout>

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- VPS of any kind (only tested on Ubuntu 24.04)
  - We recommend using [Hetzner (affiliate link)](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=7Hq0H5mQh7tM). Use the link if you want to support us. ü´∂
  - üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This should work on any system if you have pre-installed docker, node and pnpm

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel && cd openpanel/self-hosting && ./setup
# After setup is complete run `./start` to start OpenPanel
```

<Steps>

<Step>
### Clone

Clone the repository to your VPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel.git
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the setup script

The setup script will do 3 things

1. Install node (if you accept)
2. Install docker (if you accept)
3. Execute a node script that will ask some questions about your setup

> Setup takes 30s to 2 minutes depending on your VPS

```bash
cd openpanel/self-hosting
./setup
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If the `./setup` script fails to run, you can do it manually.

1. Install docker
2. Install node
3. Install pnpm
4. Run the `npx jiti ./quiz.ts` script inside the self-hosting folder

</Step>
<Step>
### Start üöÄ

Run the `./start` script located inside the self-hosting folder

```bash
./start
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Good to know

### Always use correct api url

When self-hosting you'll need to provide your api url when initializing the SDK.

The path should be `/api` and the domain should be your domain.

```html title="index.html"
<script>
  window.op = window.op||function(...args){(window.op.q=window.op.q||[]).push(args);};
  window.op('init', {
    apiUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/api', // [!code highlight]
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    trackScreenViews: true,
    trackOutgoingLinks: true,
    trackAttributes: true,
  });
</script>
<script src="https://openpanel.dev/op1.js" defer async></script>
```

```js title="op.ts"
import { OpenPanel } from '@openpanel/sdk';

const op = new OpenPanel({
  apiUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/api', // [!code highlight]
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  trackScreenViews: true,
  trackOutgoingLinks: true,
  trackAttributes: true,
});
``` 

### E-mail

Some of OpenPanel's features require e-mail. We use Resend as our transactional e-mail provider. So to get this working you'll need to create an account on Resend and set the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.

<Callout>This is nothing that is required for the basic setup, but it is required for some features.</Callout>

Features that require e-mail:
- Password reset
- Invitations
- more will be added over time

### Managed Redis

If you use a managed Redis service, you may need to set the `notify-keyspace-events` manually.

Without this setting we wont be able to listen for expired keys which we use for caluclating currently active vistors.

> You will see a warning in the logs if this needs to be set manually.
